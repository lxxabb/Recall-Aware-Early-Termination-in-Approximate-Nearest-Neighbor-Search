<h2 align="center">Declarative Recall Through Early Termination for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</h2>

Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) presents an inherent tradeoff between performance and recall (i.e., result quality). Each ANNS algorithm provides its own algorithm-dependent parameters to allow applications to influence the recall/performance tradeoff of their searches. This situation is doubly problematic. 
First, the application developers have to experiment with these algorithm-dependent parameters to fine-tune the parameters that produce the desired recall for each use case. 
This process usually takes a lot of effort. Even worse, the chosen parameters may produce good recall for some queries, but bad recall for hard queries. 
To solve these problems, we present DARTH, a method that uses target declarative recall. DARTH uses a novel method for providing target declarative recall on top of an ANNS index by employing an adaptive early termination strategy integrated into the search algorithm. 
Through a wide range of experiments, we demonstrate that DARTH effectively meets user-defined recall targets while achieving significant speedups, up to 14.6x (average: 6.8x; median: 5.7x) faster than the search without early termination for HNSW and up to 41.8x (average: 13.6x; median: 8.1x) for IVF.

## Installation
The installation prerequisites can be found in the FAISS installation instructions, which can be found [here](./docs/INSTALL.md).
To run DARTH, it is required that LightGBM is installed and is put in /HOME/lightgbm-install.
To compile FAISS with DARTH, use:
```bash
cmake -B build -S . # For the paper, we used: -DFAISS_ENABLE_GPU=OFF -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
make -C build -j faiss # Compiles FAISS with DARTH
make -C build -j hnsw_test # For the driver code of HNSW-based experiments
make -C build -j ivf_test # For the driver code of IVF-based experiments
```

<!-- cmake -DFAISS_ENABLE_GPU=OFF -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -B build -S . -->

To use the python scripts and notebooks, install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To reproduce experiments, see scripts in the `experiments` directory. 

This version of the code is refactored to be easier to use. For any questions, bugs or suggestions, please [contact the authors](mailto:manos.chatzaki@gmail.com).

## Datasets
Our evaluation utilized the following datasets: 
* [SIFT and GIST](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/)
* [DEEP and Text2Image](https://research.yandex.com/blog/benchmarks-for-billion-scale-similarity-search)
* [Glove](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)

The datasets require a minor preprocessing step to be used with DARTH. For details, refer to the scripts of [utils](./notebooks_scripts/utils).
